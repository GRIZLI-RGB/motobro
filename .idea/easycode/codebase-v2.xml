Exports config for Tailwind\\n\\nThis allows customizing Tailwind and integrating it with the project.\&quot;,\&quot;/next.config.js\&quot;:\&quot;The next.config.js file in a Next.js project is used to customize and configure Next.js behavior and features.\\n\\nSome key things it allows you to do:\\n\\n- Configure build and development settings - Things like custom webpack config, asset optimization, etc.\\n\\n- Configure routing - Set up custom route patterns, redirects, rewrites, etc. \\n\\n- Configure API routes - Set up API route handling and middleware.\\n\\n- Configure asset modules - Configure how asset modules are handled and optimized.\\n\\n- Configure experimental features - Enable/configure experimental Next.js features.\\n\\n- Configure i18n support - Configure internationalization and localization.\\n\\n- Configure images - Configure image optimization and handling. \\n\\n- Configure plugins - Add and configure Next.js plugins.\\n\\n- Configure redirects - Set up redirect rules for routing.\\n\\n- Configure rewrites - Rewrite incoming requests to different routes.\\n\\n- Configure headers - Add/modify HTTP headers on responses. \\n\\nSo in summary, it allows customizing Next.js configuration for build settings, routing, APIs, assets, features, i18n, images and more through a common configuration file. This gives control over Next.js behavior and capabilities.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/(pages)/auth/layout.tsx\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a layout component for authentication pages in Next.js.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Renders children passed to it between two divs to lay them out with some flexbox styling\\n- Imports and uses a useToggleTheme hook to handle toggling the light/dark theme\\n- Renders an image component conditionally as a background \\n- Renders a sun icon image that calls toggleTheme on click to switch themes\\n- Passes toggleTheme function from useToggleTheme to the sun icon\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Defines a layout wrapper for auth pages\\n- Handles light/dark theme toggling \\n- Renders optional background image\\n- Exports default AuthLayout component\\n\\nThe main functions are laying out the children, connecting to the theme toggle logic, and rendering the optional background + theme toggle icon.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/(pages)/auth/page.tsx\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines an authentication page component for a Next.js app.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Imports the Image component from Next.js to display a logo image\\n- Defines an AuthPage component function \\n- Renders a form with rounded corners and background styling\\n- Displays login and register buttons\\n- Renders the logo image centered below the buttons\\n- Exports the AuthPage component to make it available for use in other files\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n- Defines an authentication page component \\n- Renders login/register buttons and logo image\\n- Imports and uses Next.js Image component\\n- Styles the form container\\n- Exports the component for reuse\\n\\nSo in short, it defines the UI and layout for an authentication page in a Next.js app by rendering common auth elements like buttons and branding logo.\&quot;,\&quot;/postcss.config.js\&quot;:\&quot;This postcss.config.js file configures PostCSS, which is a tool for transforming styles with JS plugins.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Configures PostCSS plugins to use during build process\\n- Imports Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer plugins\\n- Tailwind CSS allows writing CSS using Tailwind\\u0027s utility-first classes instead of traditional CSS\\n- Autoprefixer adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules where needed to improve cross-browser compatibility\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- plugins - Defines PostCSS plugins to use \\n- tailwindcss - Imports Tailwind CSS plugin to parse Tailwind classes\\n- autoprefixer - Imports Autoprefixer plugin to add vendor prefixes to CSS rules\\n- No other PostCSS configuration needed, this file tells it which plugins to use\\n- Allows writing CSS more efficiently using Tailwind classes and gets cross-browser prefixes added\\n\\nSo in summary, it sets up PostCSS to use Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer during builds to generate optimized, cross-browser compatible CSS from code using Tailwind utilities and CSS rules.\&quot;,\&quot;/.eslintrc.json\&quot;:\&quot;The .eslintrc.json file is used to configure ESLint, which is a popular linting utility for JavaScript and JSX code.\\n\\nSome key things about this file:\\n\\n- It extends the \\\&quot;next/core-web-vitals\\\&quot; configuration. This imports a shared ESLint config from the Next.js project that includes rules related to core web vitals and best practices for Next.js apps.\\n\\n- Extending a shared config allows this project to inherit all the rules and settings defined in that config, rather than defining them manually. This makes the config simpler and keeps it in sync with Next.js recommendations.\\n\\n- ESLint rules define code style guidelines and syntax/error checking for JavaScript code. The imported config includes rules that check for things like accessibility, performance, and security best practices.\\n\\n- Running ESLint on the project will check JavaScript files against these rules and report any violations. This helps enforce code quality and catch errors early. \\n\\n- The config can be extended to add additional rules or override existing ones if needed. But by default it leverages the shared Next.js recommended settings.\\n\\nSo in summary, the .eslintrc.json file:\\n\\n1. Configures ESLint for the project \\n2. Imports and inherits rules from the Next.js recommended config\\n3. Defines code style guidelines and syntax/error checking for JS/JSX code\\n4. Helps enforce standards and catch issues through linting\&quot;,\&quot;/package.json\&quot;:\&quot;This is a package.json file, which is used to define metadata and manage dependencies for a Node.js project.\\n\\nSome key things it does:\\n\\n- Defines the name and version of the project (\\\&quot;motobro\\\&quot; version \\\&quot;0.1.0\\\&quot;)\\n- Marks the project as private, meaning it is not intended for public use\\n- Defines scripts for common tasks like dev, build, start, lint\\n- Lists dependencies for the project, including Next.js, React, React DOM\\n- Lists devDependencies for development tools like TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier\\n\\nThe main functions of this file are:\\n\\n- Provide metadata about the project \\n- Declare dependencies and versions for the project and dev tools\\n- Define scripts to run common commands like building, starting dev server\\n- Allow dependencies to be installed via npm install\\n- Provide configuration for tools like ESLint\\n\\nSo in summary, it sets up the project structure and dependencies to develop and build a Next.js app using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and other tools. The package.json is critical for managing the project setup and dependencies.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/page.tsx\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a Next.js page component for the home page.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Imports the redirect function from Next/navigation to programmatically redirect users.\\n\\n- Defines a HomePage component function that renders the home page. \\n\\n- Checks if the user is authenticated:\\n\\n  - If authenticated, it will redirect to \\\&quot;/garage\\\&quot; page\\n\\n  - If not authenticated, it will redirect to \\\&quot;/auth\\\&quot; authentication page\\n\\n- The redirect function handles programmatically changing the route/page without a full page reload.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Defines a home page component \\n\\n- Checks auth status on load\\n\\n- Redirects to auth or garage depending on auth\\n\\n- Uses Next.js redirect to change routes without a reload\\n\\nThe main functions are:\\n\\n- HomePage component \\n- Import redirect from Next\\n- Check auth status on load\\n- Call redirect based on auth check\\n\\nSo it provides routing logic and redirects for the home page based on authentication.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/layout.tsx\&quot;:\&quot;This layout.tsx file is the global layout component for the Next.js app.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Defines metadata for the app like title, favicons for light/dark themes\\n- Imports and configures the Open Sans font \\n- Imports global styles\\n- Defines a ThemeProvider component to wrap children and manage light/dark themes\\n- Renders the HTML, BODY tags and passes children inside ThemeProvider\\n- Adds styles and classes to body for minimum height, full width, and light/dark backgrounds\\n\\nIn summary, it:\\n\\n1. Sets up app metadata\\n2. Imports necessary assets like fonts and styles \\n3. Defines a layout component to wrap pages\\n4. Manages light/dark themes\\n5. Renders the base HTML/BODY structure\\n\\nSo this file acts as the global layout wrapper and theme manager for all pages in the Next.js app.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/_providers/ThemeProvider.tsx\&quot;:\&quot;This ThemeProvider file is used to add theming capabilities to a Next.js app.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Wraps the children in a NextThemeProvider component from the next-themes library. This allows theming to be applied to the children.\\n\\n- Sets the attribute to \\\&quot;class\\\&quot; so themes are applied via CSS classes rather than a data attribute. \\n\\n- Sets the default theme to \\\&quot;system\\\&quot; so it uses the system preference by default.\\n\\n- Enables the system theme detection with enableSystem.\\n\\n- Disables CSS transitions on theme change with disableTransitionOnChange for a smoother experience.\\n\\n- Provides theming context to any components rendered inside it via the children prop.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Enables theming via next-themes library\\n- Sets default theme and attribute \\n- Wraps children to pass theming context\\n- Configures theme change behavior\\n\\nSo in summary, it sets up theming capabilities in Next.js using next-themes and passes that context to child components.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/_hooks/useToggleTheme.tsx\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a React hook called useToggleTheme that allows toggling between light and dark themes in a Next.js app.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Imports the useTheme hook from next-themes which provides theme context/state management\\n\\n- Defines a useToggleTheme hook function \\n\\n- Uses useTheme() to get the current theme and setTheme function\\n\\n- Defines a toggleTheme function that calls setTheme to switch between \\u0027light\\u0027 and \\u0027dark\\u0027\\n\\n- Returns an object with:\\n  - theme: the current theme value \\n  - toggleTheme: a function to toggle the theme\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Provides a hook to toggle light/dark themes\\n- Gets current theme from context \\n- Defines toggle function to switch themes\\n- Exports toggle function for components to call\\n\\nThis allows components to easily toggle the theme by calling the toggleTheme function returned from this hook.\&quot;,\&quot;/package-lock.json\&quot;:\&quot;The package-lock.json file is used by npm to lock down the exact dependency tree that was generated when the package was installed. It records a specific version of each dependency so that repeated installs will use the same versions.\\n\\nSome key functions of the package-lock.json file:\\n\\n- Locks down the exact dependency tree - Ensures all developers and deployments use the same versions of dependencies.\\n\\n- Records dependency versions - Captures the specific version of each dependency that was installed so it can be reproduced. \\n\\n- Prevents dependency drift - Prevents dependencies from being updated accidentally which could break things.\\n\\n- Speeds up installs - Subsequent installs don\\u0027t have to resolve and download dependencies if they are already in the lock file.\\n\\n- Declares dependencies - Lists all dependencies of the project, both direct and transitive.\\n\\n- Enables reproducible builds - Ensures anyone who installs the project gets an identical dependency tree.\\n\\n- Helps with continuous integration - CI builds will get consistent results if using the lock file.\\n\\nSo in summary, it locks down the dependency tree to ensure reproducible and consistent installs across different machines and deploys. It\\u0027s an important part of dependency and version management in npm projects.\&quot;,\&quot;/README.md\&quot;:\&quot;This README.md file provides documentation and instructions for a Next.js project.\\n\\nThe key functions of this README include:\\n\\n- Explaining what the project is (a Next.js app)\\n- Providing instructions for getting started like how to run the dev server\\n- Explaining where the code lives (app/page.tsx)\\n- Mentioning the use of next/font for font optimization\\n- Linking to Next.js documentation for learning more about features\\n- Pointing to a Next.js tutorial for learning\\n- Providing a link to the Next.js GitHub repo \\n- Recommending Vercel for easy deployment and linking deployment docs\\n\\nIn summary, it orients new users to the project, explains how to set up and run it locally, links to resources for learning Next.js, and provides guidance on deployment. The README acts as the main documentation and starting point for understanding and working with this Next.js application.\&quot;,\&quot;/tsconfig.json\&quot;:\&quot;This tsconfig.json file configures TypeScript compilation and checking for a project.\\n\\nSome key things it is doing:\\n\\n- Setting the target to ES5 - this compiles TypeScript down to ES5 JavaScript for compatibility.\\n\\n- Including DOM, DOM.iterable and ESNext lib declarations - this provides type information for built-in browser APIs and modern JavaScript features. \\n\\n- Allowing JS files to be compiled - the allowJs option allows .js files to be checked and compiled.\\n\\n- Skipping lib checks - skipLibCheck skips type checking against the lib declarations.\\n\\n- Enabling strict type checking - strict enables all strict type checking options.\\n\\n- Not emitting output files - noEmit prevents output files from being generated, useful for projects like Next.js that handle compilation. \\n\\n- Enabling ES module interop - esModuleInterop allows importing CommonJS modules.\\n\\n- Configuring module resolution and imports - module, moduleResolution and paths configure how modules are resolved and imported.\\n\\n- Enabling Next.js plugin - the Next.js plugin provides Next.js specific type information. \\n\\n- Including type declaration files - include configures what files get type checked.\\n\\nSo in summary, it configures TypeScript compilation, type checking and module resolution for a project using Next.js.\&quot;}&quot;}" />
